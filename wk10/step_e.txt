Issue 1: Preventing Access to Files Outside the Web Root
Problem:
The current script allows users to navigate outside the intended directory using ../ sequences, which can expose sensitive system files.

Solution:
-> Use the basename() function to extract only the filename from the user input and prevent traversal using ../.
-> Restrict access only to a specific directory.
-> Use realpath() to resolve the absolute path and check if it is inside the allowed directory.

Issue 2: Preventing Access to Non-Existent Files/Folders
Problem:
Currently, if a user enters an invalid directory name, the script still tries to list it, causing error messages that may reveal internal server details.

Solution:
-> Use file_exists() to check if the requested directory exists before listing its contents.
-> Use is_dir() to ensure the path is actually a directory and not a file.
-> Disable PHP error messages to prevent information leaks.

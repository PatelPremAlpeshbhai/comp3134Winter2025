Encryption is critical in protecting sensitive data, such as usernames and passwords, from being exposed during network transfer. When a website uses HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure) rather than HTTP, it uses TLS (Transport Layer Security) to encrypt data before transmitting it over the network. This encryption ensures that even if an attacker intercepts the traffic with tools such as Wireshark, the data is rendered as unreadable ciphertext rather than plaintext credentials. Without encryption, attackers can easily execute packet sniffing to intercept login information or other sensitive data in transit. TLS uses end-to-end encryption to prevent man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, eavesdropping, and unwanted access, there by dramatically improving data privacy and security.

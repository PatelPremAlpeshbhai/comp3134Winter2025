ARP spoofing attacks happen when an attacker delivers bogus ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) packets to a network, allowing them to intercept, manipulate, or steal data. Network administrators can put in place a number of security measures to help prevent such attacks. Static ARP entries are an excellent method for preventing unwanted changes by manually assigning IP-to-MAC address mappings. Another method is to enable Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) on managed switches, which verifies ARP packets before forwarding them. Furthermore, network segmentation and VLANs can mitigate the impact of an attack by limiting connectivity between devices. Encryption methods such as HTTPS, SSH, and VPNs ensure that sensitive data cannot be read if transmission is intercepted by an adversary. Monitoring the network on a regular basis using tools like Wireshark or ARPwatch can help discover suspicious
